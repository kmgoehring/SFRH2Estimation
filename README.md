===============

Java code to estimate star formation rates for astronomical research.

A brief class/UI that runs calculations off user
input and returns various useful values for astronomical research
concerning star formation rates and molecular hydrogen masses.
Applies distance conversions, deprojected area and axis caluclations,
and gas and star formation rate densities.
